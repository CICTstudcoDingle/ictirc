## ⚠️ Before You Can Use It

The implementation is complete, but you need to install some dependencies first:

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install React Hook Form for admin app
pnpm add react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers --filter @ictirc/admin

# 2. Add form components to UI package
cd packages/ui
npx shadcn@latest init
npx shadcn@latest add form select textarea label

# 3. Update UI package exports (add Form, Select, Textarea, Label to index.ts)

# 4. Rebuild
cd ../..
pnpm build
```

See **DEPENDENCIES_NEEDED.md** for detailed instructions.

## 🚀 Usage After Setup

### 1. Create Conference
Navigate to: `/admin/dashboard/archives/conferences/new`
- Fill in 1st ICTIRC details
- Add organizers and partners

### 2. Create Volume
Navigate to: `/admin/dashboard/archives/volumes/new`
- Volume Number: 4
- Year: 2025

### 3. Create Issue
Navigate to: `/admin/dashboard/archives/issues/new`
- Select Volume 4
- Issue Number: 1
- Month: April
- ISSN: 2960-3773
- Link to conference

### 4. Upload Papers
Navigate to: `/admin/dashboard/archives/upload`

**Single Upload:** One paper at a time with form
**Batch Upload:** Multiple papers via CSV

Download CSV template and fill with your 20 papers

### 5. View Public Archive
Navigate to: `/archive`
- Toggle between volumes view and papers view
- Click through to see issue details
- View all papers in each issue

## 📊 Architecture

```
User Requests → Admin UI Forms → Server Actions → Database
                                                      ↓
Public Pages ← Prisma Queries ← Published Data ←──────┘
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Separate ArchivedPaper model (keeps current submissions clean)
- Volume/Issue hierarchy (flexible, supports multiple issues per volume)
- Conference model (optional link for context)
- Batch upload via CSV (efficient for bulk data)
- Public/admin separation (different UIs for different audiences)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies** (see DEPENDENCIES_NEEDED.md)
2. **Implement file upload** in storage package
3. **Add auth context** for user ID in uploads
4. **Create categories** (4 categories needed)
5. **Test end-to-end** workflow
6. **Upload 1st ICTIRC data** (20 papers)
