## ⚠️ Integration Points (Still Needed)

While the UI is complete, you'll need to integrate:

1. **File Upload** - Connect `uploadFile` from `@ictirc/storage`
   - Both upload forms reference this function
   - Need to implement actual file upload to Cloudflare R2 or Supabase Storage
   
2. **Authentication Context** - Get current user ID
   - Single upload form uses placeholder "current-user-id"
   - Need to replace with actual auth context

3. **Categories** - Create the 4 categories
   - Either seed them or create a category management UI
   - Required categories:
     - AI and Robotics
     - Computer Networking and Internet of Things (IoT)
     - Web and Mobile
     - Software Development

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a conference
- [ ] Create a volume
- [ ] Create an issue
- [ ] Upload a single paper (once storage is integrated)
- [ ] Upload batch papers (once storage is integrated)
- [ ] View public archive page (/archive)
- [ ] Toggle between volumes and papers view
- [ ] View issue detail page
- [ ] Verify paper links work
- [ ] Edit a conference
- [ ] Edit a volume
- [ ] Edit an issue
- [ ] Delete operations (test cascade protection)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Implement file upload integration in storage package
2. Add auth context to get current user ID
3. Create or seed the 4 categories
4. Test the complete workflow with 1st ICTIRC data
5. (Optional) Add paper management UI to view/edit uploaded papers
